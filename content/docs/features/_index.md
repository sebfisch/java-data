# Java Features

We now discuss selected new features in Java 17 
that help to adress the drawbacks
of defining and using algebraic datatypes in Java.
[Sealed Classes](sealed) and [Records](records)
help to define algebraic datatypes, whereas
[Pattern Matching for `instanceof`](instanceof) and
[Switch Expressions](switch)
help to process corresponding values.
We will also discuss
[Pattern Matching for `switch`](switchpatterns) and
[Record Patterns](recordpatterns)
which are planned for a future Java version
and partially available as a preview feaure.
