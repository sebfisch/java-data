# New Features

We now discuss selected new features in Java
that help to adress the drawbacks
of defining and using algebraic datatypes.
[Sealed Classes](sealed) and [Records](records)
help to define algebraic datatypes, whereas
[Pattern Matching for `instanceof`](instanceof) and
[Switch Expressions](switch)
help to process corresponding values.
Finally,
[Pattern Matching for `switch`](switchpatterns) and
[Record Patterns](recordpatterns)
further simplify data processing.
