# Algebraic Datatypes and Pattern Matching in Java

The underlying source code is available online, 
and this tutorial includes tasks to extend it.
If you want to follow along, you can use your own Java development environment
or install
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
and
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
with the
[Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
to use a predefined environment without creating (or adjusting) your own.
To use the predefined environment in VS Code
download and unpack the
[source code](https://github.com/sebfisch/java-data-code/archive/main.zip)
(or clone the
[repository](https://github.com/sebfisch/java-data-code)
using `git`),
open the repository folder in VS Code,
click on the Remote Containers icon in the bottom-left corner,
and select *Reopen Folder in Container*.
